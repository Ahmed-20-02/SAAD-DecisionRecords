# Title: ADR-005 Database 

## Context

A choice between relational and non relational databases.

## Decision

A relational database is more relevant to this visa application.

## Consequences

A relational database will provide consistency in my application due to the structured data whereas a non relational one can cause issues due to how varied the data can be presented as. Relational databases also comply with ACID, this makes the data more secure and have integrity. Non relational databases are more lenient when complying with ACID which isnt a risk worth taking when dealing with sensitive data such as the data in a visa application. 

## Status
Accepted

# Decision record template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title ADR-001 Decision Records

## Context

Decision records need to be created

## Decision

Out of two options presented, Michael Nygards template and a template made by Nat Pryce, Michael Nygards was chosen

## Consequences

We are left with a concise set of decisions that have enough information as opposed to a larger document with unecessary headings and such.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Title ADR-001 Personas

## Context

We have to make personas

## Decision

There are many ways to present personas such as paragraphs, pure images, pure sliders etc but the decision was made to follow the SHUDEV process. 

## Consequences

Makes it easier to link users needs such as accessibility requirements to user stories and looks cleaner when presented as it is visualised.

# Decision record template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title ADR-001 Decision Records

## Context

Decision records need to be created

## Decision

Out of two options presented, Michael Nygards template and a template made by Nat Pryce, Michael Nygards was chosen

## Consequences

We are left with a concise set of decisions that have enough information as opposed to a larger document with unecessary headings and such.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Title ADR-002 Personas

## Context

We have to make personas

## Decision

There are many ways to present personas such as paragraphs, pure images, pure sliders etc but the decision was made to follow the SHUDEV process. 

## Consequences

Makes it easier to link users needs such as accessibility requirements to user stories and looks cleaner when presented as it is visualised.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Title ADR-003 Architectural Styles

## Context

An architectural style must be chosen to develop this project in 

## Decision

There are a multitude of architectural styles available, each with their benefits and drawbacks. The chosen style is Domain Driven. 

## Consequences

DDA (Domain Driven Architecture) supports my functional and non functional requirements as it isolates aspects of the system which allows domains and sub domains to be upgraded and scaled when necessary.

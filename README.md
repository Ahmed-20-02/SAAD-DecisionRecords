# Decision record template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title ADR-0001 Personas

## Context

We have to make personas

## Decision

There is many persona templates to choose from, the decision was made to follow the SHUDEV process for personas. 

## Consequences

Makes it easier to visualise users needs and map user stories to characters

# Decision record template by Michael Nygard

This is the template in [Documenting architecture decisions - Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
You can use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) for managing the ADR files.

In each ADR file, write these sections:

# Title ADR-001 Personas

## Context

We have to make personas

## Decision

There are many ways to present personas such as paragraphs, pure images, pure sliders etc but the decision was made to follow the SHUDEV process. 

## Consequences

Makes it easier to link users needs such as accessibility requirements to user stories and looks cleaner when presented as it is visualised.

# Title: ADR-003 Architectural Styles

## Context

An architectural style must be chosen to develop this project in 

## Decision

There are a multitude of architectural styles available such as Microkernel, MVC, Event Driven, Domain Driven and layered, each with their benefits and drawbacks. The chosen style is Layered.

## Consequences

Layered architecture supports my functional and non functional requirements as it isolates aspects of the system which allows a separation of concerns. This makes it easier to upgrade and scale layers when necessary. This also makes it more SOLID. 

## Status
Accepted

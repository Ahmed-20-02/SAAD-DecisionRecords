# Title: ADR-006 Data Model 

## Context

A choice between ERD and Class Diagram.

## Decision

A Class Diagram reflects my architectural style better, therefore Class Diagram is chosen.

## Consequences

A Class Diagram is the perfect way to demonstrate the plan to use Object Relational Mapping. 
Specifically LINQ which uses entities to manipulate database data. A class diagram can represent entities in this sense.

## Status
Accepted

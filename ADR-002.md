# Title: ADR-002 Personas

## Context

We have to make personas

## Decision

There are many ways to present personas such as paragraphs, pure images, pure sliders etc but the decision was made to follow the SHUDEV process. 

## Consequences

Makes it easier to link users needs such as accessibility requirements to user stories and looks cleaner when presented as it is visualised.

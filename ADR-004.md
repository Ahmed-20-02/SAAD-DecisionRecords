# Title: ADR-004 Wireframes

## Context

Wireframes need to be developed.

## Decision

The choice was from the following design software, Figma, Lucid Chart, Draw.io and Mockplus. I didnt choose Figma due to previous difficulties, Lucid Chart and Draw.io are great for diagrams and such which left me to use Mockplus. 

## Consequences

Mockplus provides great templates to start off with and also provides ratios for different views. It also provides useful icons and drag and dropable components. It also features interactions between components to mock sequences.

## Status
Accepted
